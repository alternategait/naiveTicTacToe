# naiveTicTacToe

Tic-tac-toe is a classic game that many people make as an intro to programming. I have several ideas, and only want to use my own approach (for now), which is why I'm calling it naive. I will of course be researching methods and syntax as needed; only avoiding tic tac toe specific tutorials and article. As of 8/22/22 I have css box and an array of event listeners.
